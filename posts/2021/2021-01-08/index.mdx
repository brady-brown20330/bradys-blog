I'm getting more interested in build & burns. These are quick little projects that can demonstrate some specific competencies while not taking up a whole lot of time. This one will be a little more broad, we're going to create a quick TODO list app that will allow users to perform full CRUD operations on a list that they create.

CRUD operations reffer to the four main operations that are involved in most user stories. It stands for:

Create: User should be able to add new items
Read: User should be able to see items that they have added
Update: User should be able to edit items they have added
Delete: User should be able to delete items they have added

Who deosn't love a good acronym?

Anyways to start off I'm going to be using the starter code that I built in my previous post (linked at the bottom), just so we immediately have a place to add our components & server routes.

As mentioned in the title, this app is going to be full stack, so it will have its own server routes and database included. When building full stack apps, I like to start at the back end, and work my way forward. I find that if I start by building out the database schema & server routes I have a better idea of wheat the data will actually look like, and building the frontend is pretty easy once you understand that.
